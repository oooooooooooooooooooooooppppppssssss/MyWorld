# MyWorld
My Goal with this script was to create a data set of patients which displayed their name, age, country, and a score between 0 and 10 signifying their history of drug use. I wanted to do something that compiles as quickly as possible and works with large data sets. I also wanted to create a search system, which currently is limited to searching by country. Future Ideas that I might have integrated by the time you are reading this are:

1. Searching by Age
2. Displaying all Male/Female Patients
3. Creating a "Endangered List" that lists all patients of age 18 and above that have a drug score of 8 or higher
4. Creating a "Juvenile Endangered List" that lists all patients of age 17 and below that have a drug score of 8 or higher.
